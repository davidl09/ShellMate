There are changes to be committed and changes not staged for commit. To handle this, I will first add the changes not staged and the untracked files to the staging area and then commit everything together, including the already staged modification to `.gitignore`.

I will first add the README.md, pyproject.toml, raw_log.txt, and test directory to the staging area.

```shell
git add README.md pyproject.toml raw_log.txt test/
```
